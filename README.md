**Project Summary:**

This project has two primary aims:
* **Aim 1:** To characterize the longitudinal growth trajectories of early behavioral motor indicators in relation to cortical activation patterns in 2–6-month-olds. This will involve using correlational analyses, specifically canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial correlation analysis, to examine associations between repeated behavioral measures and simultaneously acquired cortical activation data.
* **Aim 2:** To determine the predictive value of infants’ 2-6 month behavioral and neural motor indicators on characteristics of 12-month infant vocalizations. This will be examined using linear mixed-effects modeling (LMM) to understand how early motor indicators (like non-nutritive sucking variables and fNIRS data) predict vocalization characteristics at 12 months.

A power analysis was conducted, to estimate an appropriate sample size, suggesting N=24 based on an estimated effect size (Cohen's f ≈ 0.905) with an α = 0.05 and 0.8 power, assuming six predictors in a linear mixed-effects model.

* **`Analytic Approach.docx`**: This document outlines the analytical methods for the project. It details the approaches to focus on characterizing longitudinal growth trajectories of early behavioral motor indicators in relation to cortical activation patterns in 2–6-month-olds using correlational analyses (CCA and partial correlation). It also includes a preliminary power analysis.
